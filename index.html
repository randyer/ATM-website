        <h3>Full Body Soft Tissue Release</h3>
        <p>
          Pain, tight muscles, or headaches are common complaints treated.
          Flexibility, spine movement, increased circulation, pain relief, and
          muscle relaxation are some effects of this treatment. A more focused
          session rather than a full body treatment is also available.

        <h3>Brain Healing & Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          Restrictions in and around the brain and spinal cord are released,
          resulting in increased nutrition to the brain, clearing of waste
          products, drainage, reduced inflammation, reduced scar tissue, and
          better cognitive processing. This treatment is appropriate for
          concussions, TBIs, and most neurological dysfunction and diseases.
        </p>

      <div>
        <img src="calm.png" alt="calm" />
        <h3>Relaxation</h3>
        <p>
          The parasympathetic nervous system is activated and balanced through
          treatment which has a calming effect. Disruption of the digestive
          system due to anxiety and stress can also be addressed with this
          treatment achieving a more complete relaxation.
        </p>

        <img src="heart.png" alt="holding heart" />
        <h3>Somato Emotional Release</h3>
        <p>
          Interestingly, emotion can be stored in body tissue during injury or
          trauma. Somato Emotional Release (SER) allows for the release of
          tension patterns that are held because of an emotional component.
          However, treatment is only intended for use in conjunction with
          psychotherapy.

            Light pressure is primarily used, since the craniosacral rhythm is
            very delicate. Tigntness and tension patterns in the muscle and
            fascia are found and treated. Energy work can also be used when
            nessesary.

            You will remain fully clothed during treatment. With that in mind,
            wear comfortable clothing Ex: t-shirt, stretchy pants, sweatpants.

            Pam is a very detailed, understanding, and the most kind therapist
            I've ever gone to. I would highly recommend her to anyone. Her
            understanding and flexibility is a five-star. <br />

            Pam is knowledgeable, thorough, present and most certainly
            therapeutic. Instead of forcing the body to comply, her
            understanding of the body, mind and spirit connection enables her to
            use gentle touch to restore balance. <br />

            Pam is AMAZING! After a very long time of struggling with hip, back,
            and leg pain, Pam was able to relieve it all in just a few visits.
            It was not what I expected at all. But it is exactly what my body
            needed...and done with great care and compassion. This is the place
            to go...no question!!! <br />

      <p>
        I've been a practicing Massage Therapist since 2009, treating clients
        with Deep Tissue and Swedish Massage for the first few years. However, I
        have transitioned to practicing Craniosacral Therapy exclusively. The
        results are just as good, if not better, with a much more gentle
        approach. I used to live by the saying, "no pain, no gain" but I've
        found that isn't the case when it comes to Craniosacral Therapy.
        Craniosacral Therapy through the Upledger Institute has opened my eyes
        to amazing and effective alternatives to the typical massage treatment.
        I offer my clients a fix for muscle tension issues as well as relaxation
        and stress relief. In addition to muscle and fascial tension release, I
        also specialize in treating brain injury and neurological conditions.
        Common treatment of conditions include concussions, migraines, and TBIs.
        I couldn't be happier to offer both relaxation and pain management
        through Craniosacral Therapy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The human body is miraculous, and we're only beginning to understand
        it's capabilities. My approach is a combination of both eastern and
        western methods with a sound foundation in anatomy and science. If you
        need a positive, energetic and caring Craniosacral Therapist, please
        don't hesitate to contact me to find out how I can help you restore and
        revitalize yourself.
